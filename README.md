# Safekeep Fullstack Challenge

## About this project
Seems like you're trying out for a position at Safekeep or you've found this and would like to apply. Fork this repo and give it a go. ;)

Your goal is to create a simple CRUD application.

The GIF below will show you what needs to be done. The input fields will be a person's name, surname and hours of participation - calculate the participation percentage afterwards. Create a table and pie chart for to visualize the data. You can use any library for the visualizations, we suggest react-charts or react-apex-charts. Styling is up to you - the more pleasureful it is the more pleasing it will be to us. However, the design should be responsive for mobile and web applications (see the GIF).
